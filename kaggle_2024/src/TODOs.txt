Some things I would like to do but do not have time:

-- Find the ideal hyperparameters from the validation set using randomsearch
-- Explore more features (e.g. vehicle odometer reading / Vehicle Age)
-- Add code to see if the training set and validation set are similar (Cohen's D?)
-- Chain the entire pipeline together to run everything end to end in one go
-- Lint imports
